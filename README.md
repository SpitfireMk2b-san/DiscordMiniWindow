# MDW (Mini Discord Window)

Mini Discord Window (or MDW) is a small, subtle window that displays messages in a certain Discord channel while staying on top of whatever you are doing.

## Installation

Download from the GitHub releases section or clone the repository (if cloning the repository and running the python files, be sure to install everything in requirements.txt), then refer to "Usage" below for instructions.

## Usage

First, launch the "UI" app or script. Wait for the window to appear, which should take at most a second. Then, launch "DSC". It will ask for your [Discord token](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-user-token) and the [ID](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-server-id-or-a-server-channel-id) of the channel/DM you want to watch. Then, after a couple seconds you should see the last few messages from the channel fill up the window. Enjoy!
